# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Task

Build a Calendar Application with hourly timeblocks for the working hours of a day.

User story

I arrive at the website with the current date and time displayed at the top of the screen. I can then scroll down and see color-coded timeblocks
depending on the time of the day. The present hour timeblock is red, future hour timeblocks are green and previous hour timeblocks are white.
I can then enter information into the text area within the timeblocks. I can save this information. When I save the information and refresh
the page the information is still present.

Appearance: the following image shows the website's appearance and functionality
